# osu-resize
An image tool that allowed osu skinners to automaically resize @2x textures to their smaller size.
This program was requested by someone who does very much with osu! skinning.

# How do I use it?

Simply drag the @2x files on the .exe file. The program will start loading and resizing the textures.

# Where will the resized textures be?

The textures will be saved in the same directory as the source textures. 

# What if a non-@2x texture already exists?

If the destination texture already eixsts, the user is asked on if it should be overwritten.

# Requirements

Runs on Windows with .NET Framework 4.7.2 and System.Drawing
